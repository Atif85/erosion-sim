# Erosion Simulator

A Godot 4 project for simulating terrain erosion using compute shaders. 
For now it just has hydraulic erosion.
Its very inspired by the video by sebastian lague

## Features

- Procedural terrain generation using FastNoiseLite
- Hydraulic erosion simulation
- Erosion heatmap visualization (see where erosion and deposition occured)
- UI for adjusting noise and erosion parameters
- Export heightmaps as PNG images

## Planned Features

- **Thermal erosion** (simulating landslides and slope-based material movement)
- **Wind erosion** (simulating sand/dust transport by wind)
- More erosion types and visualization options

## Why?

I made this project to learn Godot 4 and experiment with compute shaders for real-time terrain simulation.  
Itâ€™s open source feel free to use, modify, or contribute.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/).
3. Run the main scene to start experimenting.
